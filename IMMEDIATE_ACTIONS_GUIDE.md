# Immediate Actions Guide

This guide covers the immediate actions needed to test and build your mobile app.

## 🚀 Action 1: Test PWA Functionality

### Step 1: Verify PWA Assets
```bash
# Check if manifest is accessible
curl http://localhost:8000/manifest.json

# Check if service worker is accessible  
curl http://localhost:8000/service-worker.js
```

### Step 2: Test PWA Installation
1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`
2. Look for the "Install" or "Add to Home Screen" prompt
3. On mobile devices, you should see an "Add to Home Screen" option
4. Test offline functionality after installation

### Step 3: Verify PWA Features
- [ ] App can be installed from browser
- [ ] App icon appears on home screen
- [ ] App opens in standalone mode (no browser UI)
- [ ] Offline caching works
- [ ] Responsive design on mobile

## 🔧 Action 2: Build Android App

### Option A: Install Android Studio (Recommended)

#### Step 1: Install Android Studio
```bash
# macOS (using Homebrew)
brew install --cask android-studio

# Or download from: https://developer.android.com/studio
```

#### Step 2: Install Android SDK
1. Open Android Studio
2. Go to Tools > SDK Manager
3. Install:
   - Android SDK Platform 34 (Android 14)
   - Android SDK Build-Tools 34.0.0
   - Android SDK Platform-Tools
   - Android Emulator

#### Step 3: Set Environment Variables
```bash
# Add to your ~/.zshrc or ~/.bash_profile
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin

# Reload shell
source ~/.zshrc
```

#### Step 4: Build APK
```bash
# Open project in Android Studio
npx cap open android

# In Android Studio:
# 1. Wait for Gradle sync
# 2. Build > Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) > Build APK(s)
# 3. APK will be in android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/
```

### Option B: Command Line Build (Advanced)

#### Step 1: Install Android SDK Only
```bash
# Download Android SDK Command Line Tools
# https://developer.android.com/studio#command-tools

# Extract to ~/Library/Android/sdk/cmdline-tools/latest/
mkdir -p ~/Library/Android/sdk/cmdline-tools/latest
# Extract downloaded zip to this directory
```

#### Step 2: Install Required Packages
```bash
# Set ANDROID_HOME
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk

# Install SDK packages
$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/sdkmanager \
  "platforms;android-34" \
  "build-tools;34.0.0" \
  "platform-tools" \
  "emulator"
```

#### Step 3: Build APK
```bash
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

## 🍎 Action 3: Prepare iOS Build

### Step 1: Install Xcode
```bash
# Install from Mac App Store or:
xcode-select --install
```

### Step 2: Open iOS Project
```bash
npx cap open ios
```

### Step 3: Configure Signing
1. In Xcode, select your project
2. Go to Signing & Capabilities
3. Select your team
4. Update Bundle Identifier if needed

### Step 4: Build and Test
1. Select target device/simulator
2. Product > Build
3. Product > Run (for testing)

## 📱 Testing Your App

### PWA Testing
```bash
# Start Django server
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

# Test on different devices:
# - Desktop browser
# - Mobile browser
# - Install as PWA
```

### Android Testing
```bash
# Check connected devices
adb devices

# Install APK
adb install android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk

# Test deep links
adb shell am start -W -a android.intent.action.VIEW \
  -d "https://lexipark.onrender.com/analysis/" \
  com.lexipark.app
```

### iOS Testing
```bash
# Test deep links in simulator
xcrun simctl openurl booted "lexipark://analysis"
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### PWA Not Installing
- Check if HTTPS is required (some browsers require it)
- Verify manifest.json is accessible
- Check service worker registration in browser console

#### Android Build Fails
- Verify ANDROID_HOME is set correctly
- Check SDK installation in Android Studio
- Ensure Java 11+ is installed

#### iOS Build Fails
- Verify Xcode version (15+ recommended)
- Check signing certificates
- Ensure iOS deployment target is set correctly

### Quick Fixes

#### Reset Capacitor
```bash
# If things get messy
rm -rf android ios
npx cap add android
npx cap add ios
npx cap copy
```

#### Update Dependencies
```bash
npm update @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli @capacitor/android @capacitor/ios
npx cap sync
```

## ✅ Success Checklist

- [ ] PWA installs and works offline
- [ ] Android APK builds successfully
- [ ] iOS project opens in Xcode
